## Motivation
FCAT is an Equadorian NGO responsible for the conservation of a 650-hectare reserve in the tropical Andes. Last year, FCAT acquired a property spanning 42-hectares, with plans to use the land as a hub for forest restoration and research. Working with a large collaborative team across many institutions, FCAT monitors recovery outcomes for a wide range of ecological processes over the course of the restoration experiment. These efforts depend on daily collection of soil data, a process currently done by hand. Moiré aims to automate the data collection process (in addition to increasing its accuracy) with a mesh network of sensors distributed across the reserve, which measure and transmit data daily. Sensors can be monitored or managed via this React Frontend.
